## Description

React Quotes is a ReactJs App with Google Firebase database in use. I used
react-router's routes and useHistory() hooks to make it a multi-page app.
Custom react hooks and reducers were used to increase code-reusability, 
primarily for dealing with the Google Firebase requests and replies.
React suspense tags are used to take use of lazy-loading to speed up the
apps crucial components.
